            <h1>Chatrapati Shivaji</h1>
            <p>
                Shivaji Bhosale was an Indian warrior-king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out an enclave from the 
                declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned as 
                the chhatrapati (emperor) of his realm at Raigad. Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities
                 with the Mughal Empire, Sultanate of Golkonda and Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as European colonial powers. Shivaji's military 
                 forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil 
                 rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of Marathi and Sanskrit, 
                 rather than Persian language, in court and administration.Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time,
                 but he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement.

            <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>
            <p>
                Swami Vivekananda  was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna.
                He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness,
                 bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India,
                  and contributed to the concept of Indian nationalism as a tool of fight against the British empire in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the 
                  Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words - "Sisters and brothers of America .
                   in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893
                   Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, 
                   from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's death.

            <h1>Narendra Modi</h1>
            <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi  born 17 September 1950 is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014.
                 He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
                 and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two
                  consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
                    Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, 
                    beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi,
                 which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later..</p>
